A light wallet version for those who want to use and trade XEL coin before the final (computable) version is ready.

This software is highly experimental and may contain unknown bugs.
By using this software you clearly state that you are using the software at your own risk.
This means, that nobody else except you is liable for any kinds of losses that are connected to Elastic, it's implementation, the protocol design or anything similar. Especially, Elastic is not meant to be speculative or used as any kind of storage of value; if you act differently you do it at your own risk anyway.

If you do not accept this disclaimer
or if you live in a jurisdiction where running a cryptocurrency
or if you live in a jurisdiction where using cryptography
or if you live in a jurisdiction where any other part of Elastic/XEL might be illegal (or not explicitly allowed)
or if you live in a jurisdiction where this disclaimer does not have 100% vailidity
then you are not allowed to proceed and use Elastic at all.
