Android permission Cordova plugin
========

This plugin is designed for supporting Android new permissions checking mechanism.

Since Android 6.0, the Android permissions checking mechanism has been changed. In the past, the permissions were granted by users when they decide to install the app. Now, the permissions should be granted by a user when he/she is using the app.

For old Android plugins you (developers) are using may not support this new mechanism or already stop updating. So either to find a new plugin to solving this problem, nor trying to add the mechanism in the old plugin. If you don't want to do those, you can try this plugin.
