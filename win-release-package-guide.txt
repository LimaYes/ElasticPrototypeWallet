FIRST PREPARATION (ONLY DONE ONCE)

1. Install Windows
2. Install JAva JDK 1.8 from Sun and make sure that JDK bin/ directory is in PATH (usually it is not)
3. Install Git for Windows

9. Download 32bit JRE 1.8 from Sun in .tar.gz format (for Windows: jre-8u131-windows-i586.tar.gz) and unzip the content of jre1.8.0_131\ into the jre/ folder you just created. In a way that you

BUT INSTEAD YOU HAVE
jre\bin\ or jre\lib\
